The nature of each possible singular configuration is discussed and the singularity loci for a constant orientation of the mobile platform are obtained.

  abstract = {This paper studies the kinematic geometry of general 3-RPR planar parallel robots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have simple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore, their kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel robot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic model, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots are determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is geometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic model. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of freedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted. Finally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations performed on an actual robot prototype are presented.},

Starting from a short introduction regarding the motivation and necessity of the emergence of such parallel mechanisms, some basic terms are presented, in the context of founding the existence of several terminologies for certain specific expressions of this subject, as well as different definitions for them. Then, after a short presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of the parallel robots, compared to serial ones, and of the parallel kinematic mechanisms compared to the conventional machine tools, some publications related to kinematics, dynamics, modeling and simulation of these types of mechanisms are highlighted. This research is realized in order to identify a solution that will be the basis for the development of a prototype, both virtual and experimental, for such mechatronic system.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new method for optimal calibration of parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) is presented. The basis of the methodology is to exploit the least error sensitive regions in the workspace to yield optimal calibration. To do so, an error model is developed that takes into consideration all the geometric errors due to imprecision in manufacturing and assembly. Based on this error model, it is shown that the error mapping from the geometric errors to the pose error of the PKM depends on the Jacobian inverse. The Jacobian inverse would introduce spurious errors that would affect the calibration results, if used without proper care. Hence, areas in the workspace with smaller condition numbers are selected for calibration. Simulations and experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Calibration software based on the proposed method has been embedded in the tripod developed at the National Research Council of Canada’s Integrated Manufacturing Technologies Institute.},
